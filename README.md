## Git Strategies
### Branching
1. Always start journey by branching out from `develop` into a friendly branch name of choosing.
2. Once we've performed our magic, create a pull request (PR) to merge our changes back into `develop`.
3. Once we've met a major milestone a pull request (PR) can be made from `develop` back into `master` which requires at least one approval to reach a consensus on the changes ðŸ˜œ
